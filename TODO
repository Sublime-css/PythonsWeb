bughunting:

--hovering on the first navlink makes a hover background that obscures the border, this is not present in any other navlink!
--Third and fourth table in the pagelist don't take up whole screen width!
--Admin buttons need a doubleclick the first time the page is visited!
--databaseInsert crashes when a pagee already exists with that pagenum, and sometimes for no (known) reason at all!
--navbar links get a 1px space between them when on tablet-sized screen!
--

TODO now:

--visual diary (permanant).
--fix the text spacing in dynamic content boxes.
--make videos embed properly.
--insert/delete should only list pagenum values that are available.
--index.php needs a better fallback than to shout about the lack of data.
--

TODO future:

--Admin authentication?
--Sign in?
--Share with class?
--search function?
