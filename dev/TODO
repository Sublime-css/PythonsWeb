bughunting:

--hovering on the first navlink makes a hover background that obscures the border, this is not present in any other navlink!
--Third and fourth table in the pagelist don't take up whole screen width!
------Admin buttons need a doubleclick the first time the page is visited! //Fixed, document.getElementById().style.display defaults to "" not "none" or "null".
------databaseInsert crashes when a pagee already exists with that pagenum, and sometimes for no (known) reason at all! //Fixed, page number list only shows those that do not already exist and quote marks -------no longer break everything.
------navbar links get a 1px space between them when on tablet-sized screen! //Fixed, this is an issue with the google renderer.
------debug messages appear 4 times on admin page   //Fixed, didn't need to reconnect to the database 4 times in the same page:thinking:.
------databaseInsert crashes if the text includes a ' character //Fixed, they are removed from the SQL string and things are much tidier.

TODO now:

--visual diary (permanant).
--fix the text spacing in dynamic content boxes.
--make videos embed properly.
--insert/delete should only list pagenum values that are available. //Done
--index.php needs a better fallback than to shout about the lack of data.
--

TODO future:

------Admin authentication? //Done
------Sign in? //Done
--Share with class?
--search function?
